This repository contains the code for a data management system that consists of
two main components:

- a Flask-based Python web server (`pydatalab`) that communicates with a MongoDB
  database backend and can perform simple analysis and ETL of particular data types,
- a Vue 3 web application for a GUI that can be used to record information on
  samples alongside raw data files and analysis documents.

The system was developed for and is currently deployed for the
[Grey Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/grey/)
in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge.


## Features

### Server

- A REST API for accessing data and analysis related to chemical samples,
  inventory and their connections.
- OAuth2-based user authentication via GitHub or ORCID and simple user role
  management.
- Real-time data streaming and syncing with remote data sources (e.g., instrumentation, archives and file stores).

### UI

- A simple, intuitive UI for recording sample metadata and relationships with
  other samples (batches, offshoots), alongside synthesis parameters and raw data.
- Basic analysis and plotting of live and archived data attached to a sample, e.g.,
  characterisation via XRD or NMR, electrochemical cycling data and images -- see Blocks for a complete list.
- Interactive network visualisation of the connections between samples and inventory.

## Development status

The software is still an alpha work-in-progress and the API, data models and UI may
change significantly between versions.


## Installation

Installation, usage and deployment instructions can be found in
[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) and in the [online documentation](https://readthedocs.com/datalab).
